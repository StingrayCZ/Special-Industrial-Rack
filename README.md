# Special Industrial Rack

Every growing production always goes hand in hand with the logistics problem. A properly functioning production facility must carry certain requirements such as effective order in warehouse for fast give in or put out finished or semi-manufactured parts for the next process. There is certainty in that these companies are able to create a professional solution for us, but such a solution will be very expensive.

The main problem was the difference between the shapes of each object (part) and their non-compact shape, which made it impossible to stack these parts on top of each other. Another problem was that I had to use an already purchased mass-produced rack - [see here](https://github.com/StingrayCZ/Special-Industrial-Rack/blob/master/Picture/RackBlank.PNG). At the end of the day, this rack was quite small for storing all the necessary parts. Based on this facts I have decided that I use some the building kit system, specifically [Item 24](https://www.item24.com/). This solution has many advantages as great variability for future changes and conversions.

After finished the design I entrust a drawing documentation to our buyer for order a material for build our special rack. Unfortunatelly the suplier offered an unacceptable price, more then €2,600. Following the rejection of the previous design, I was under time pressure and only had three days to create the same thing (design), but cheaper - the budget was € 400. So I designed a simplified design where I used cold formed carbon steel sheets.

## Intital design
The first proposal is based on aluminium profiles and contains full-bulk of intended parts. That design was abandoned due to high cost and unacceptable consuming of time for build.

### Detail (without stored parts)
The second layout used carbon-steel-sheet parts with applying a protective zinc coating. But due to simplification the rack can carry only 80% from reqiered parts.
