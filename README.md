# Special Industrial Rack

Every growing production always go hand in hand with logistics problem. Right working production facility must carry certain requirements such as effective order in warehouse for fast give in or put out finish or semi-manufactured parts for the next process. On the market we can find many companies who made a special equipment for industirual warehouses. There is certitude that some companies are able to make a professional-level solution for us but such solution must be very expensive.

In my case I had to make a design of rack which is able to carry aluminium-sheets parts and subassemblies. Main problem were differencies among shapes of each object and also their non-compact shape which made it impossible for simply pallet-stacked. Second problem was that I had to use already bought a serial-produced rack - [see here](https://github.com/StingrayCZ/Special-Industrial-Rack/blob/master/Picture/RackBlank.PNG). Last but not least, this rack was quite small for store all intended parts. Accoriding to this facts I have decided that I use any of the building kit system, specifically [Item 24](https://www.item24.com/). This solution has many advantages as whole variability for future changes and rebuilt. After finished the design I entrust tasks to order material for build a rack with carrier items. The s

Following the refusal previous design I was under time pressure and had only three days for made same thing but cheaper â€“ budget maximum was 400 Eur. So I suggested a simplified design where I used coldformed carbon steel-metal sheets.

## Intital design
The first proposal is based on aluminium profiles and contains full-bulk of parts. That design was abandoned due to high cost and unacceptable consuming of time for build.
