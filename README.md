# Special Industrial Rack

Every growing production always goes hand in hand with the logistics problem. A properly functioning factory must have order in the warehouse for efficient delivery, parts, or  semi-finished products for the next production process.  On the market we can find many companies who made a special equipment for industirual warehouses. There is certainty in that these companies are able to create a professional solution for us, but such a solution is usually very expensive.

The main problem was the difference between the shapes of each object (part) and their non-compact shape, which made it impossible to stack these parts on top of each other. Another (second) problem was that I had to use an already purchased mass-produced rack - [see here](https://github.com/StingrayCZ/Special-Industrial-Rack/blob/master/Picture/RackBlank.PNG). At the end of the day, this rack was quite small for store all intended parts. Based on this facts I have decided that I use some the building kit system, specifically [Item 24](https://www.item24.com/). This solution has many advantages as great variability for future changes and conversions.

After finished the design I entrust tasks to our buyer for order a material for build a rack. Unfortunatelly the suplier offered an
unacceptable price, more then €2,600. Following the refusal previous design I was under time pressure and had only three days for create a different and cheaper version – budget maximum was €400. So I suggested a simplified design where I used coldformed carbon steel-metal sheets.

## Intital design
The first proposal is based on aluminium profiles and contains full-bulk of parts. That design was abandoned due to high cost and unacceptable consuming of time for build.
